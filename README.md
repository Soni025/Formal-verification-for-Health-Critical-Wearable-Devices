# Formal-verification-for-Health-Critical-Wearable-Devices
## Overview
This research paper delves into the application of formal verification techniques in ensuring reliability and correctness of health-critical wearable devices, focusing on data monitoring. Since the use of wearables is increasing in healthcare, it is essential to verify that the data generated by these devices is accurate and fault-free. This research seeks to integrate machine learning with formal verification tools to validate the performance and correctness of data collected by health-monitoring devices.
## Objective
The primary goal of this study is to evaluate formal verification approaches applicable to small-to-medium scale software, especially health-critical wearable devices. In addition, the research examines the incorporation of machine learning techniques into formal verification methods in order to improve reliability and real-time data monitoring.
## Methodology
1.) Dataset Used: The data is collected from health-monitoring devices. It contains parameters such as ActivityHour, Value, Calories, StepTotal, and refined outlier values like RefinedOutlier_Value, RefinedOutlier_Calories, and RefinedOutlier_StepTotal.
